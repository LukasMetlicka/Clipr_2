#Clipr.
##The first online clip solution.
Ever been helping a friend debug his code and wish you could access those little snippets of code you keep in a .txt file on your desktop so you don't have to spend so much time typing?  An awnser to your problem has come.  Clipr utilizes login authentication and several database tables so that you can easily and securely create clips that can be accessed anywhere.  Clips use a hashtag system to organize clips, so that they can be easily grouped for later use. (functionality stripped) Your clips can be viewed on your home page, which displays your clips for ease of copying.

#Notes:
due to time constraints while dealing with servere bugs, several features have been removed that I had hoped to implement:

1. Sorting clips by tags
2. search functionality
3. viewing all tags
4. viewing a clip page
5. using multiple hastags
6. restricting users from editing hashtags that are not their 

Unfortunately, while trying to install windows on my computer, I accedentally formatted my hard drive, costing me hours of valuable time on wednesday night on reinstalling mac osx from a timemachine backup.  unfortunately, this project isn't a honest representation of my best work, and I wish I had dealt with bugs sooner, as well as had some better circumstances, to make this project something I am proud of.  I probably should have attended sections, however, I was working a full time job in addition to classes, and this made sections hard to make.  Please don't take this as me trying to excuse my incomplete work, but more as a reference of understanding so that this class may improve.  All in all, I have no regrets about taking this course, and although it was very challenging for me and I don't think I really displayed my abilities to their potential, I learned a lot in this course.
